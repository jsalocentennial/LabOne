            <p>Welcome to my Portfolio! I am a 2nd year Software Engineering student who is interested in
                software design and building games. I work full time in aviation and attend classes on my
                days off.
            </p>
            <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
                <p>My intention is to learn how to program and build software the right way. I am not programming
                    to get a job, but to follow my own interests. Each project I complete I see as a tool to learn
                    more and become a more competent programmer. 
                </p>
